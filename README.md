# rock-paper-scissors

In this simple beginner friendly code without much restrictions of whether the user enters wrong input.
using basic skills of javascript such:

1. Assigning variables.
2. Good variable names.
3. Assigning init value to the variable.
4. Using function and adding parameters to the function.
5. Assigning the parameters their value.
6. Calling and invoking a function.
7. Use of console.log to print an output.
8. if,else if and else statements to create condition and return output if condition is met.
9. Use of for loops to make it a game of rounds.

etc. other basic javascript functions like using string methods to lower case a string.

Using such basic javascript fundamental skills i created just a simple rock-paper-scissors game that can be simply played via dev tools console.
It's a simple game from a simpler perspective of a begginer just starting out with javascript.
Easy to understand what is going on flawlessly line by line.

First few lines before the function to playGames() is step by step on how i tackled the problem by solving the sub-problems first then the overall function playGame that concatenate everything together with few added codes.
